Together it means 'back of the rock/crag'. This follows a common Gaelic naming pattern where landscape features are described in relation to each other. The presence of the Gaelic article 'na' is particularly diagnostic of Gaelic origin, and the word order follows Gaelic syntax.

This naming pattern is very common in Scottish toponymy, particularly in central Scotland where Gaelic was historically spoken. The combination describes a field or plain in a hollow, which is consistent with the topographical naming patterns of Gaelic place names.

The '-ton' suffix is a widespread Germanic toponymic element found throughout Scotland, particularly in areas of Anglo-Saxon influence.
