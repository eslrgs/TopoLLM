The element 'stadh-' resembles Norse 'staðr' meaning 'place/settlement', and '-gearraidh' likely comes from Norse 'gerði' meaning 'enclosed field/garth', a common element in Norse place names in the Western Isles of Scotland. This pattern is typical of Norse-origin names that have been Gaelicized in the Hebrides and Northern Isles. The lack of typical Gaelic prefixes or Brittonic elements, combined with these Norse components, suggests Viking settlement influence, though the modern spelling shows Gaelic adaptation.",Medium
